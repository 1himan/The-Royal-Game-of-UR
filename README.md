# The Royal Game of UR: Online Edition

Greetings, noble traveller of the digital realm! You have stumbled upon a relic of ancient times, a game so old it makes the pyramids look like they were built yesterday. Welcome to the online version of **The Royal Game of UR**.

## Overview

This game, dear friend, is not for the faint of heart. It is a battle of wits and strategy, a contest that has been enjoyed by kings and queens, pharaohs and emperors, for over 4500 years. And now, through the magic of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, Node.js, and Socket.io, this ancient game has been brought to life in the modern world.

## The Journey

The creation of this game was a journey in itself. Over the course of three weeks, I delved into the depths of coding, learning new skills and overcoming numerous challenges. Each problem faced was a stepping stone, leading me closer to the completion of this project. The journey was arduous, but the knowledge gained and the satisfaction of bringing an ancient game to life in the digital world made it all worthwhile.

But the journey does not end here. In the spirit of the ancients, who were always striving for improvement, I too am planning to enhance this game. I have recently added a room functionality, allowing more than two players to engage in this ancient battle of wits. I have also worked on adding interactive features to improve the user interface.

## How to Play
